# Machine Learning Projects: Iris Classification & Parkinson's Disease Detection

This repository contains two beginner-friendly machine learning projects that showcase how models can learn from data to make predictions:

1. **Iris Flower Classification**  
   - Predict the species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using key flower measurements.  
   - Uses **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**.  
   - Includes visualizations like scatterplots and pairplots to explore the data.

2. **Parkinson's Disease Detection**  
   - Predict whether a patient has Parkinson’s disease based on biomedical voice measurements.  
   - Compares **Logistic Regression** (linear model) and **Random Forest** (non-linear model).  
   - Includes exploratory data analysis, PCA visualizations, and decision boundary plots.


### Iris Flower Classification
- Load and explore the Iris dataset.  
- Visualize relationships between features using pairplots and scatterplots.  
- Train Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.  
- Compare model performance and analyze feature importance.

### Parkinson's Disease Detection
- Load and preprocess the Parkinson’s dataset.  
- Explore data patterns with correlation heatmaps and PCA.  
- Train Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.  
- Visualize decision boundaries and compare accuracy.  
- Analyze whether linear assumptions hold for this dataset.
